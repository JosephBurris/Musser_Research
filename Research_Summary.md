So, I really did enjoy doing research this summer. I really appreciated Professor Musser for accepting me and I was really glad to work with real hardware, something that Mizzou unfortunately doesn't really touch on much. I learned a lot of new skills, like creating sockets and basic threading techniques. Also, working with drones gave me a new perspective on how to integrate software with hardware. Also, I learned a lot about creating 3D models, setting up 3D environments, and animating the 3D objects within those environments with just python and the Panda3D api alone.

Professor Musser, if you are reading this, thank you for the opportunity this summer.
