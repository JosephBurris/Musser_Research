These are just VERY basic notes from the test that I ran with my brother where he created a simple program with the tello drone. Essentially the program just connected to the drone, took off, and landed.

· Basic questions about python objects

· Small confusion about the order in which methods are called

· Questions about the “command” command… may need to change the wording on the description slightly

· Thought a need to copy/paste ip and port into all other commands

· Thought he needed to connect again after connecting to the drone

· Name of objects is slightly confusing

· Agrees to 3D testing technology (Would feel more comfortable with trying new commands and running them)

· Not too easy.

· No fear of breaking the drone, but more likely would try out some slightly more dangerous commands

· Physical drones are a HUGE captivator. Would be more likely to take the class if using a physical drone.

I will also post the code that he created called "Josh_Test.py" in the main repository. I definitely had a hand in helping him out with the test a little, but it was mainly just to do my best to explain what python objects are and how they function/what they can do.

Biggest take-away from the test:
* The MAIN draw for a class in which basic programming is taught through drone technology is, of course, the drone itself. My brother was VERY specific that if the class just used the 3d Modeling software that I created to test drone programs, then he would not be as drawn to taking it (the physical drone is very important).
* Lastly, it is important to note that he said that he would be MUCH more confident in taking the class if he had a way to test code before going to the physical drone itself (like the 3d Modeling software I made).
