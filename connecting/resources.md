Actual program: https://github.com/dji-sdk/Tello-Python/tree/master/Single_Tello_Test

Notes on program:
* Connecting to program:
  * The original connection to the drone itself is accomplished in the tello.py document.
  * It appears to connect to the drone itself using the socket and threading python libraries to connect to the drone. While I am unsure exactly how this is accomplished... (finish after successful test)
