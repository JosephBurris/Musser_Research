I wanted to create this to document my troubles with getting PyOpenGL to not only create 3D models, but also just work on my machine. (As well as provide mental compensation for the amount of time that I wasted looking at it)

The main issue that I ran into with creating 3D environments using PyOpenGL is the lack of specific examples that I could find on the web. I was heavily surprised that there was such a lack of examples.

Even if I was to find the examples on the internet that I needed, the amount of downloads that are required to run any PyOpenGL programs is INSANE. After a while I did manage to find a couple of examples, but even then I wasn't even able to run them on my machine.

I struggled with trying to run a successful program on my machine for about a week (given breaks for frustration) until I just realized that it was NOT a good solution for 3D modeling. I want to document more about what I did with OpenGL, but unfortunately there is just nothing to report, just a couple of non-functioning python documents that I downloaded and attempted to run on my machine unsuccessfully.

Luckily, after the next meeting Professor Musser introduced me to Panda3D, which I guess I totally overlooked, and it is MUCH easier and friendlier to use! However, that came with its own share of problems which I list in my Panda3D_Notes document.
